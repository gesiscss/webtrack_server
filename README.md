WebTrack is a web browser plugin that captures the web browsing behavior of users who volunteer to participate in web tracking studies. WebTrack was developed within the project “Reciprocal relations between populist radical-right attitudes and information behavior: a longitudinal study of attitude development in high-choice information environments” lead by Silke Adam (U of Bern) and Michaela Maier (U of Koblenz-Landau) and funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation (100001CL 182630/1) and the German Research Foundation DFG (MA2244/9-1). The software was transferred to GESIS in 2021 where WebTrack was maintained and further developed. For academic use of the tool, please consider the below license.  

This repository webtrack_server_interface_public contains the code for the frontend interface of the WebTrack server. The repository webtrack_server_public contains the code for the backend of the WebTrack server. The repository webtrack_extension_public (link) contains the code for the frontend of the browser extension.  

The Chrome Browser API will be updated from V2 to V3 in June 2024. The tool is tailored towards V2 and will not be maintained anymore for version V3.
